## The App Brief
 
A copy of the brief can be accessed [here](static/assets/readme/design_brief.md)
 
## Summary of the brief
 
The client has requested a web app that has full functionality as an e-commerce store, must be styled and follow assumed functionality and layout from both users and partners.
 
This project will be used on a closed server as part of the marketing material to attract potential brands to the platform ready for when they launch later on in the year. 
 
This website will be used as a showcase to present the business to perspective brands; therefore, the web app must demonstrate an essential but complete user journey for both the brands(partners) and potential shoppers(users).

## UX
 
### Target Audience
 
There is more detail for the target audience in the website brief. However, as the web app operates as a platform, there are two categories of the audience that the app needs to service.
 
### Partner
 
Partners; are SME businesses that produce products aimed at the Mixed Race community. Potentially does not have a massive online presence, and that can see being part of the platform to increase the companies sales and revenue.
 
### Users
 
Users; are customers with either mixed heritage backgrounds or in a mixed household who are looking for an easier way yot find products specifically for the unique needs that they face, which are currently not catered for on mainstream sites.
 
## Website Goals
 
### Client
 
To make a web application that:
 
- is easy to use and understand
- will motivate/draw users back to the site each week
- needs to be responsive on mobile and desktop
 
### Users
 
As a user, I want:
 
- to be able to find and search for items easily

Here are examples of successful user journeys.
 
Here is the successful journey of a user.
 
- I have been redirected to the app via a marketing campaign.
- I have noticed a product I would like to buy.
- I have clicked to view more information about the product to see if it matches my needs.
- I have selected an amount to purchase.
- I received some sort of feedback from the app letting me know it has been successful
- After more shopping, I can see my whole order in the cart/bag feature.
- I can enter my details for delivery
- I can then use an online payment form to process my payment.
- I received a verification email about the order.
- I liked the experience, so I created a profile and saved my details
 
Here is the successful journey of a Partner.

## User Stories
 
These user stories revolve around essential actions for each user and the desired software outcome to satisfy the user need.
The user stories that I use to build the functionality of the app are available [here](static/assets/readme/design_brief.md)
 
## Sections of the Web App
 
### General Layout
 
The client is not looking for an MVP; they need something that they can use to promote the brand and bring in brands to become part of the community of sellers on the platform.
 
### Navigation Bar
 
The navigation bar should be simple and easy to understand.  The user should be able to identify if they are logged in or not. This bar should only have the relevant information available for the user. I.e. not showing login option when logged in.
 
Must have a quick and easy way to access filtered product searches, possible by category in a drop-down menu. 
 
This will be hidden on smaller screens and replaced with a pop-out menu.
 
### Home page
 
The home page should be quick and easy to navigate. Which follows the standard navigation practices, copy about the project must be visible, the design must think about potential promoted space where brands could be charged a premium for HTML real estate.
 
### User and Partner Profile pages
 
The profile page must have all the basic user information, with an easily identifiable way to update data. Must not be cluttered with information; details can be split over pages.
 
### Products page
 
The product page should be easy to navigate, with no clutter, just simple cards showing each product with an easily identifiable way to narrow down product searches.
 
Products on the page must be paginated to a reasonable amount.
 
### Product view page
 
The product view page should show more detailed information about the product, with a quick and straightforward way to choose an amount to order and then order.
 
### Partners pages
 
The partner's page should show all our partners on bigger displayed cards than the products, must show the given selected image from each brand, and have a link to the brand page. 
 
Must have search by name options.
 
### Partner pages
 
The partner page should show more details about the story of the brand and have a link so the user can see all the products by the given brand.
 
### Cart and Checkout pages
 
The cart and checkout pages should be similar in design and layout.
 
Should be plain to allow the user to focus on nothing else but finishing the order.
 
## Wireframes
 
Here is a sample of the original wireframes for the app approved by the client.

## Design
 
The design elements were influenced and informed by the client’s brief. The unique design is kept to a minimum and follows industry standards on the look and navigation of the site.
 
### Font
 
### Copy
 
- Poppins and as a backup sans-serif
 
### Headers
 
- Abril Fatface and as a backup cursive
 
### Main colours
 
Brand colours are ![brand](static/assets/readme/brand_colours.jpg)
 
## Features for the website
 
### Responsive design
 
- Websites must be functional on both large and small screens.
 
### Interactive page
 
- Page HTML must be interactive for the user and must feel fluid.
 
## Technologies Used
 
### Languages
 
HTML5 - I used HTML 5 for the layout and structure of the website.
 
CSS - CSS has been used to style some HTML elements.
 
jQuery - jQuery language has been used to create front end interactivity of some HTML elements from Materialize CSS.
 
JavaScript - I have used custom JS to add to the interactivity of DOM elements.
 
Python - Python has been used so the app can interact with the database.
 
Postgres- I chose to use Postgres as the database to store all of the necessary data that the app uses.
 
Django Template - This language was used to manipulate the HTML depending on what data returned from various Python functions.
 
## Frameworks
 
## App - Django
 
I used the Django framework to build the app. This framework has sped up the coding process and given a solid foundation to the app.
 
## Styling - Materialize
 
I have used Google Materialize to standardise the styling of this app. For example, selecting the elements I want and then copying and pasting the code into the HTML and any jQuery code needed to make the element interactive.
 
## Python Libraries
 
I used modules to help me code the app faster using pre-written code to speed up the process.
 
- os - This module allows the app to have access to the operating system, giving the app the ability to access environment variables.
- Django - This module is the framework for the app, allowing the app to have a user and connect to other apps.
- DateTime - This module has been used to record timestamps by the app.
- UUID - I used this module to create ids for database entries.
 
## Outside libraries
 
- Font Awesome - I used font awesome for some of my icons.
 
## App dependencies
 
The full list of dependencies can be found [here](static/assets/readme/design_brief.md)
 
## Software Used
 
- Git: I used Git to manage the app's development, committing regularly.
 
- Git Desktop: I used this to manage commits and push them to the GitHub repository.
 
- GitHub: I used GitHub to store the version of the project remotely.
 
- Adobe XD: I used XD to create and build the wireframes.
 
## VS Code
 
I used VS Code as my code editor. In the code editor, the extensions that I used were:
 
- Black: automatically format my code for basic formatting mistakes and have a consistent style throughout the code.
- Image preview: I used this extension to identify whether or not the image URL path is correct.
- Markdown all in one: I used this extension to help me edit the readme file in VS Code.
 
## Website Structure
 
The diagram here is a layout of the website’s information structure and how it will flow for the user.

</details>
 
## Coding Architecture
 
I have used a simple architecture for this app with all the code from each language in one file and separated the code into sections by comment lines.
 
## Database
 
I used SQL lite in the production and then Postgres for deployment to Heroku.
 
Both are Relational Databases, which create a table for each object that a relationship can link together.
 
### Schema
 
I am using various relationships to connect each database table, for example:
 
Many to many - I am using this relationship to connect Product and Tag tables, as each product can have more than one tag, and each tag can be assigned more than one product.
One to many - I used this relationship to connect partners with the products. They have in their store, as one brand can have many products for sale. 
One to one - I used this relationship between profiles and wallets.

## User Input Validation
 
I used a mixture of HTML and Python code to validate user input. On HTML verification techniques I also used python code to validated, as HTML can be easily manipulated. This is to ensure that the user data is correct before being sent to the database.
 
### HTML
 
 
### Python

## Issues and challenges I encountered
 
The biggest issue I found in the development of this application was the storing of images, as image files are likely to be uploaded as jpg files, which would slow the website download speeds. So I researched how to do this in the model, which took a few days to get right.
 
## Known bugs
 
- Image bug - 
 
- AttributeError - 
 
- Session Bug -

## Deployment
 
I used one GitHub branch, so clone the main branch in the repo.
 
### How to deploy
 
### Run this code locally
 
Clone this project from GitHub by the terminal:
 
- Under the repository name, click Clone or download
- In the Clone with HTTP section, copy the clone URL for the repository
- In your local IDE, open Git Bash
- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
- Type git clone and then paste the URL you copied in Step 2
<https://github.com/josephWoodland/Mixed-Origin-MS4.git>
- Press Enter, and your local clone will then be created.
 
Clone this project from GitHub by the Git Desktop:
 
- Under the repository name, click Clone or Download
- Click the option to use GitHub Desktop
- In the clone, Repository Modal choose where you would like it to be stored locally
- The clone has been created and stored in your local file.
 
Further reading and troubleshooting on cloning a repository from GitHub can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
 
### Running the code
 
To deploy the app locally, once you have cloned the repository, you will need to create an env.py file in the directory to create the development environment.
```
import os
  os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "<Your secret key>")
  os.environ.setdefault(
      "MONGO_URI", "mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<project>.af8bz.mongodb.net/<database>?retryWrites=true&w=majority")
  os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "<database>")
 
```
 
### Deploying to Heroku
 
You will need to sign up for Heroku
Once logged in, click the create new app button
Select the region closest to you and give the APP a name
Set your deployment method to 'GitHub.'
Connect to GitHub and login
Search for the repository you wish to deploy from
You will have to add your `Config Vars` this will be everything you have in your env.py so that Heroku will have all the keys needed to use the app.
You will need to have a `Procfile`, and you will have to update a requirements.txt, so the app has all the necessary extensions to run.
 
From there, you should be able to deploy the app.

## Future Features - App Roadmap
 
### Emails to Partners
 
I would like to build out the automated email function, so we can send each owner of a product ordered an email with the product and order details. 
 
### Blog Section
 
- The next feature to expand from the core business model would be to populate the blog section in the app.
 
### React Framework
 
- I would like to use the react framework for the front end and use Django as a rest database by the time the website is live.
 
### Unit Testing
 
I would like to further develop the unit testing in the code already.
